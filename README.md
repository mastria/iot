# IOT Project

Welcome to the **IOT** project! This repository contains various example codes and tests for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that I needed and developed. It also serves as a personal repository to store useful snippets and implementations that can be integrated into my IoT projects. Each example demonstrates specific functionalities tailored to my requirements.
